#Ajax Basics
* Ajax is something we use on the client side.
* It stands for *A*synchronous *J*avaScript *a*nd *X*ML
* the page doesn't wait for it to finish
* it happens in the background

^ And we'll tlak a little more about that down the line

---

# Why would we load data asynchronously??

* Rather than have your page load data for everything.
* Load a list of items, then when you click on one, create an Ajax request to grab more info from your server on that particular item

---

#No refreshes

* Allows us to send and receive data in the background, we don't need to have the page refresh!
* Keeps our apps fast and responsive
* We only request/send the data that we want

^ Another huge benefit

---


#Asynchronicity
##Whats it mean when something happens asynchronously?

- we need to wait for it to finish

---
```JS
console.log('one');

someFuncThatTakes5Seconds(function(){
  console.log('two');
});
console.log('three');
```

---

#How

* Ajax uses good ole http requests! with all the methods and headers that go with that.
* We do this in JS by creating a XMLHttpRequest(), giving it a url, and calling `send` on it
* It gets pretty long however.
* And its a lot shorter...

---
#With jQuery

```js
var promise = $.ajax({
  method: "GET",
  dataType: "json",
  url: "/dogs"
  success: function(data, status, response ) {
    // do something with the data
  },
  error: function(data, status, response) {
    // handle the error response
  }
})
```

---

#Dissecting This
* Create the request by passing in URL, method, what datatype we want, headers etc.

---

#`POST`ing Data

```js
var payload = { "name": "Sparky" };
$.ajax({
  method: "POST",
  url: "/dogs",
  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  dataType: 'json',
  data: JSON.stringify(payload),
}).done(function(data, status, response) {
    // ...
});
```

---
#jQuery shortcut methods

* `$.get(url)`
* `$.getJSON(url)`
* `$.post(url, obj)`

---

# Client and Server

**remember**, the client doesnt know about the server, the only way that they can communicate is through the client making HTTP requests, and the server sending responses

---

#Now what?

We can combine Ajax with the DOM manipulation weâ€™ve already learned to get data from our servers, and display stuff interactively, then when users click, they can see new information, all without a page reload!
