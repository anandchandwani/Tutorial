#Why Open Source.

The fundamental purpose of open source licensing is to deny anybody the right to
**exclusively** exploit a work.

- when you buy a cd, youve bought th right to license to that music, to use that function
- software is dynamic though, you can use a piece of software in another

^ Typically, in order to permit their works to reach a broad
audience, and, incidentally, to make some sort of living from making works, cre-
ators are required to surrender all, or substantially all, of the rights granted by copy-
right to those entities that are capable of distributing and thereby exploiting that
work.
