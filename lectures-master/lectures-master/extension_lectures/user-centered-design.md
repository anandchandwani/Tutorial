#User-Centered Design (UCD)

###What is UCD?

User-Centered Design is an approach to product design/development that maintains a persistent focus on users throughout the planning, creation, and deployment of that product. 

---

###Why should we care?

- *My users are the reason I'm making this product.* 
- **This is your new mantra, repeat it daily**
- User acquisition/retention is hard enough when your product is well-designed. If you aren't thinking about your users' needs, you aren't thinking about how to keep them engaged with your product.
- Thinking carefully about your users and their needs takes a great deal of guesswork out of design (and makes planning easier!).

#Design patterns (and pitfalls) 

---

**Non-design / Unintentional Design** Building a product without paying attention to design, users, or use cases. Any design that happens is incidental.
	- *Pros:* No user-focused time/effort required during planning and development.
	- *Cons:* Very risky; chance of landing on a usable/optimal design is low. Likely to require modifications after release/negative user feedback.

---

- **Solving Your Own Problems / Self-Design** Designing a product with yourself/your team in mind. (You're your own target user.)
	- *Pros:* Completely viable for internal tools.
	- *Cons:* Not everyone works the way you do/has the same problems you have. You're limiting your audience to people just like you, and likely missing out on a larger user base.

---

- **Experience-Based / "Genius" Design** Construct a product using design lessons learned from past experience and/or the guidance of a designer.
	- *Pros:* Experienced designers have acquired knowledge from past product cycles that may prove useful to your current product. Some design best practices are patterns, and can be repeated for many scenarios.
	- *Cons:* Feedback is critical to good design, and not supplying your designer with input about your current product means that they may miss something special. Most great designers approach their work scientifically, constantly seeking feedback and testing hypotheses.

---
- **Function-Driven / Activity-Focused Design** Crafting use cases and designing for them, but limiting design focus to activities and actions.
	- *Pros:* Workflow focus is important, and paying attention to user actions means that it's likely that decisions will be made with ease of use in mind.
	- *Cons:* This can be difficult to do when actions are new/different from familiar tasks or the team cannot relate to activity contexts.

---

- **User-Centered Design** Designing with the user at the center -- paying attention to app activities, action contexts, and user goals/motivations. 
	- *Pros:* Most likely to lead to a product that users will engage with; user observation can help designers identify hidden needs and patterns of behavior that would not be discoverable under another design approach.
	- *Cons:* Time-consuming; requires research and knowledge of user (or target user).
	
^ (This list goes from low user focus to high user focus.)

---

- The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
- Users are involved throughout design and development.
- The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
- The process is iterative.
- The design addresses the whole user experience.
- The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.[^1]

###Design Deliverables

---

* **Personas** represent our "typical" users. 
	- conduct or read market research to determine representative traits and motivations of various user segments.
	- These deliverables include dossiers for a sample set of fake users.
  - Give your users names, ages, backgrounds, careers (or lack thereof), hopes and dreams, fears, and opinions.
  - The more "real" a persona seems, the more effective they will be. 

^ Select a stock photo for each persona.

---
	
- **Scenarios** are brief stories involving personas. They involve opinions, feelings, habits, and motivations, and are often structured as "day in the life" narratives about specific personas.
	- Some relate directly to the product/app 
	- Others provide context 
	- Scenarios should help shape the way you design interactions for users, but shouldn't be the end-all-be-all

^ how long they've been a user, how deeply they engage with the product, specific actions they wish to take with the product. 
^ for their opinions or inclinations -- a tendency to check a mobile device during the workday, a preference for buying the latest technology, a mistrust of applications that ask for credit card information. 

^different user types may have conflicting scenarios, and you'll have to make a decision about what's best for either your highest-priority users or the majority of your users.

---

- **Use Cases** are statements that describe interactions (generally, with the world -- specifically, with your product). 
	- Many formats for crafting use cases, a list of *actors*  and set of *actions* or *steps*.
	- break down processes from an interaction standpoint 
	- Specific to a given interaction, often written in groups pertaining to a feature. 
	- Typically, use cases will have 2-5 steps or items per case, though some may be more extensive. 

^ (versus agile stories, which, though connected to user needs, target business or technical requirements).
^ You may have a set of use cases for user account creation and login, purchase transactions, or other features that users will engage with.
^ Be as detailed as you need to be to communicate the basics of the interaction, but don't go into so much detail that you're actually building it.
