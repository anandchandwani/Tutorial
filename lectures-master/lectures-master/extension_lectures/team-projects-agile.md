#Agile Manifesto
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

#How do we do this?

* User personas
* Build features - (Don't write code)
* User Stories
* Point them

#Mary can log in and create an event.

- mary can log in (with what?) > mary can log in with email and password
- mary can create an event > When mary is logged in, she can see a calendar. 
- When mary is logged in and sees a calendar she can click it and see a pop up to select start and end times.
- Mary can save start and end times
- When mary is logged in she says her previous events.
