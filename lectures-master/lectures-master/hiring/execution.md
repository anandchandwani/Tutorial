#Execution Based Questions

---

#Examples

Write me a program to print out a Tree

---

#Questions

- **communication** and **clairity** are focus
- show that you are an engineer they want to work with on tough technical problems
- the problems are usually chosen by the interviewer
- won't necessarily have a right answer (focus is point 1)

---

#Tips

- **generalize** the problem
- **diagram** the problem out
- **pseudocode** solution
- **test** your solution out

---

#Generalize

- Do you understand the problem?
- Repeat the question back to interviewer in your own words
- Ask questions for clarification

---

Example

*"Write me a program to print out a Tree"*

How should I print out the tree? Breadth first or Depth first?

*"Good question. Breadth first"*

Okay. Should I print it it out in-order, post-order, or pre-order?

*"in-order would be great"*

---

#Diagram

- Draw the data structure and talk through the problem
- Does not need to be a perfect solution
- Go through potential solution step-by-step
**Communication** is key

---

#Pseudocode
Write out code like you're reading out code
**Avoid** unnecessary syntax and language-specific terms
Assume you have necessary functions and data structures and implement those later

---

Example

```
printTree(leftBranch)
print(currentNode)
printTree(rightBranch)
```

---

#Test
- Run through your code line-by-line
- While testing your code, all the matters is what you wrote
- Think about edge cases and potential optimizations
- Understand the time and space complexity of the code
